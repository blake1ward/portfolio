This document outlines the new pre-registration features for Best Western properties using Visual matrix.

When a guest submits a CRS survey provided in a welcome email, Visual Matrix puts that reservation into a "pre-registered" state.

## Pre Reg in Front Office

### Searching

In Reservations, the guest search field now has a "Pre-Registered" option. Use this option to filter for guests who are in a pre-registered state.

The "pending arrivals" search has been updated to include statuses for pre-registered reservations.

- **PRG**: "pre-registered guaranteed"
- **PRH**: "pre-registered hold"

### CRS Comments

With a pre-registered reservation open, click the **PRE REG** status, located in the middle frame next to Room Rate, to open the CRS Comments window.

Select the **PreReg Notes** option to see the notes. 

The notes are organized in a question-and-answer format. These comments tell you when the guest performed the mobile check in, when they will arrive, additional requests, and flight number.

### Supervisor: Reservation Management

If a reservation is pre-registered, the "Pre Reg" status will now appear in the Arrivals By Day and the Reservation Detail window.

- This function is useful if you are pre-blocking rooms so you can see reservation details that will help you select the right room for a guest.

- Double click **PRE REG** to open a CRS Comments window.

### Supervisor Reports

The "Status" column in the Arrivals Report has been updated to include pre-registered statuses.

- **PRH**: "pre-registered hold"
- **PRI**: "pre-registered in" (checked in)

## Pre Reg in Management

### MCI Interval

The **Mobile Check-in Interval (MCI)** is how often Visual Matrix will pull down pre-registration surveys from central reservations. You can adjust that interval in the Best Western 2 Way interface.

### MCI Cutoff

The **MCI Cutoff** time triggers a warning dialog when there are pre-registered guests who have not been assigned a room. The pop up dialog will occur regularly until all pre-registered guests have been assigned a room.
