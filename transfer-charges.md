To retroactively send the charges that are already posted:

1. Search for the group.
2. Set the group's guarantee type to **All Charges** or **Room & Tax**.
3. Go to the Cashiering section.
4. Click **In House Guests** on the function icon menu.
5. Select the reservation from the group you want to transfer charges from.
6. Click **Send**.

If the group has multiple rooms, repeat steps 4-6 on each room from which you want to send charges
back to the group master.
