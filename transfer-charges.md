To retroactively send the charges that are already posted:
1. Search for the group.
2. Set the group's guarantee type to all charges or room & tax.
3. Open a reservation from the group in Cashiering, one in which you would like to
transfer charges to the group master.
To do that, go to the Cashiering section, click the In House Guests function,
and then select the reservation.
4. Click Send.
If the group has multiple rooms, repeat step 3 on each room that you want to send charges
to.
