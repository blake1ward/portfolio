<h2>Hotjar</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hotjar.com">Hotjar</a>* is an analytical tool that I use to supplement my Google Analytics. There are two features that I mainly use that have been really helpful: heatmapping and user recordings. The "basic" plan for these features is free.</p>

<p>I am going to focus on the heatmapping in this post. I will make a post about user recordings sometime later.</p>

<h2>Heatmapping</h2>

<p>The free version of Hotjar gives you three heatmaps to manage. They max out at 2,000 views. Although some websites will hit 2,000 views quickly, I think that it is a large enough sample size to make an accurate heatmap.</p>

<p>You can click through user devices and heatmap types at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>For my site, the "scroll" heatmap is not very useful. I am mostly interested in how users interact with my main landing page.</p>

<p>Here is a "click" heatmap.</p>

<p>And a "move" heatmap.</p>

<p>A few things I learned from these:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Users are clicking on the menu tree on the left rather than the buttons in the middle.</li>
 	<li>They aren't really using Popular/New/Updated articles (maybe I should just get rid of it entirely?).</li>
 	<li>They use the search bar frequently, but are not interested in refining their searches (this has led to a large number of of search queries with no results; I have to tag my articles more thoroughly).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can hover over a tracked area to see how many clicks users made.</p>

<p>I now know that, besides Tools, the training videos are the most popular items in the knowledge base.</p>

<p>My intention is for users to use the menu tree on the left side of the screen. However, seeing the number of page views that came from a mobile device made an impact on my navigation design. I did not know, before using Hotjar, that a potential 1 out of 40 pageviews is mobile. The menu tree isn't visible for mobile users, so I made sure that clicking through those main buttons is just as smooth an experience.</p>

<p>Hotjar integration into your website is very easy to do. For a free service, I highly recommend using it.</p>
