title: "In response to "Generalist Versus Specialist"
----

<p>This is written in response to Tim Johnson’s article, <a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/2016/12/20/changing-roles-of-technical-writers/">“Generalist versus specialist: What should you focus on with knowledge building in your tech writing role?”</a></p>

<p>In his article, Tim Johnson lists ways he can contribute that don’t require specialized, technical knowledge of the product/software. I think this is a resourceful list to take out of context of the larger argument of the piece. I am not going to address the generalist versus specialist argument. Rather, I would like to flesh out how I fit into my current workplace on each of these criteria he lists.</p>

<blockquote>“I can see the larger picture of the documentation and integrate the information holistically where it fits, adjusting other topics and making the whole doc coherent and seamless.”</blockquote>

<p>In so many words, I wasn’t stuck in a habitual way of seeing how the software and documentation relate and how clients use it.</p>

<p>The company had an issue with their end-user documentation. After I had some time to play with the software, we decided to scrap the old documentation, and I would write new, comprehensive documentation from the ground up. I think that having a fresh eye on the documentation helped them to adjust their expectation of what to get out of it (where before they weren’t getting much and weren’t expecting much) and the benefit of scrapping what, looking in from the outside, was not really working.</p>

<blockquote>“I can build doc publishing tools that maximize the user experience by providing navigation, search, tags, and other good UX features for users. (Most engineers know very little about documentation websites or publishing.)”</blockquote>

<p>I made a knowledge base decked out with all of the UX features and analytical goodies.</p>

<blockquote>“I can solicit the information we need, commit engineers to write, and push the content through the appropriate approval channels. (In short, I would be a kind of producer on a movie set, directing actors and scenes for the desired result.)”</blockquote>

<p>With the team I work with right now, I mostly use Slack as a chat/file sharing program for short-term tasks and Git repository for bigger projects. With one person, I use a free service called Wrike.</p>

<blockquote>“I can analyze user feedback from forums, support logs, search queries, metrics, websites, and other channels. Based on my analysis, I could take action to either solicit the needed content, adjust the existing content, or provide more strategic direction about any gaps.”</blockquote>

<p>I try to check analytics daily. If I am especially busy, I at least check them two or three times a week.</p>

<p>The knowledge base is used worldwide. Different users use it for vastly different objectives. It is new, and most of the hotel properties using it have not had a knowledge base to reference (there was an old one, but most customers were not aware of its existence — if they were aware, it was outdated and wholly incomplete).</p>

<p>I designed the knowledge base to be a one-stop help portal with, to me, a user-friendly, intuitive navigation design. I learned, though, because of the customers inexperience with a knowledge base, and my own shortcomings/missed opportunities in the nav-design, that the users were feeding me tons of useful information, daily, that would affect my design. Search queries and heatmaps have been huge. I learned that my meta-tags on a lot of articles were only half complete, and some of the things that I thought were easily navigable to were actually “buried” for many users.</p>

<p>User feedback does the testing that you can’t holistically do. See the first point, above, from Johnson’s article. With the proper tools and attention, the users naturally fill in the organizational gaps in my documentation.</p>

<blockquote>“I can organize authoring workflows with git and repos to allow engineers to write and collaborate, submit pull requests, and push out new content somewhat autonomously. Orchestrating this distributed git workflow for doc can help us scale our efforts across the company.”</blockquote>

<p>We can improve how efficiently we communicate, every day. I like being able to work autonomously, but teamwork is more important on big projects in my technical current writing role.</p>

<blockquote>“I can analyze the information architecture of the doc site, how various products are organized, how users navigate to them, and provide the right tags and facets to increase findability across the documentation.”</blockquote>

<p>I find having an accordion style navigation menu on either side of the screen to be really effective. I’ve monitored one using heatmaps, and it was used more frequently than the navigation buttons in the main part of the page.</p>

<p>Refined search options and the ability to track search terms that users input have really affected the way I tag things. Especially tracking search terms that didn’t yield the user’s expected results.</p>
