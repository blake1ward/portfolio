title: User recordings with Hotjar
---

<p>Hotjar* lets you record users as they use your website. The recording only captures the content within the user's web browser, so don't worry, there's nothing creepy or invasive about user recordings. They are anonymous (although, they can be filtered by country) and do not show keyed items. They simply tracks mouse movement, clicks, and scrolling so you can see how they are interacting with your site.</p>

<p>Unlike a heatmap, a user recording will track through multiple pages on your site. The recording starts when the user first lands, then it tracks them until they leave. Looking at these will help you recognize some of your UX design's strengths/issues so you can tailor your site for more quality views.</p>

<p>Here is the bar from a recording on one of my sites:</p>

<img href="#" alt="" width="669" height="75" />

<p>The symbols on this interface denote user actions:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Yellow dot = "Visited new page"</li>
 	<li>Red dot = "Mouse click"</li>
 	<li>White line = "Page scroll"</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see that this user opened the site, went to a few pages, and then did something else for about five minutes. When they came back (starting where the video is currently at) They visited a dozen pages or so without scrolling much. It wasn't until the last few pages they visited that they scrolled through and looked in-depth at what is on those pages.</p>

<p>You probably don't have time to watch a 10 minute recording of one user. There are options at the bottom to change the recording speed and skip the pauses to speed up the viewing process. I find the action markers the most useful, however, in determining where I will watch the user's actual mouse movements.</p>

<p>On the right side of the recording are two tabs for session information and notes on actions.</p>

<img href="#" alt="" width="298" height="461" />

<p>This tool has a lot of potential value for your site, and it's free. When you reach the limit to the number of recordings you can have, you just have to delete some and Hotjar will resume recording new users.</p>

<p>*Once again, I am not affiliated with Hotjar. I made this post because I like the feature.</p>
