<h3>"Write bad.
Revise good."</h3>

<p>-Steve Almond, signed in my copy of his short story collection, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/God-Bless-America-Steve-Almond/dp/0984592237/ref=sr_1_cc_4?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1485817864&amp;sr=1-4-catcorr&amp;keywords=steve+almond">"God Bless America: Stories."</a></p>

<p>The consequence of good editing is good writing. I am convinced that multiple revisions make the writing great. There are "great writers," but I would not trust myÂ ability to produce something great, first try, consistently.</p>

<p>When I started to produce more writing, I thought that through persistence was really good writing made. I was starting a simplified Outliers-esque journey of churning out more, more, and more, until one day *whoosh* the mediocre writing would stop, and everything coming from my fingertips would be, from that point on, really good.</p>

<p>Production (writing) is important. Pounding out words is important. Word-counts, however, are not the goal of writing. By shifting my focus to be a detail-oriented editor, rather than an on-the-fly writer, I see a huge difference in the quality of my output.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/kenneth-koch">Kenneth Koch</a> writes about this in his poem, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=33016">The Art of Poetry</a>. This is about poetry, but the message is just as applicable to technical writing, business writing, medical writing, fiction, non-fiction, lyrics, scripts, poetry, grocery to-do lists . . .</p>

<blockquote>To look at a poem again of course causes anxiety
In many cases, but that pain a writer must learn to endure,
For without it he will be like a chicken which never knows what he is doing
And goes feathering and fluttering through life. When one finds the poem
Inadequate, then one must revise, and this can be very hard going
Indeed. For the original "inspiration" is not there. Some poets never master the
Art of doing this, and remain "minor" or almost nothing at all.

'First Versions'... can never win the praise
Of a discerning reader until they take hard-hearted Revision to bed...</blockquote>
