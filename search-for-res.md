To locate a reservation in your system:
1. Click &nbsp;<img src="/portfolio/images/Search-for-a-Reservation.jpg" alt="search">.
2. Select an option from the **Search Options** dropdown.
3. Input a **date range**.
4. Type the search criteria under the Search Field.

Some Search Options do not give you the option to type; there are Search Options
with preset Search Field options. For example: the Search Option “Room Type."

There are specific and general search option criteria. For example, a search for Guest
ID # could yield a more exact result than a search for Guest Last Name if the guest
has a common surname.

If you know the approximate date of the reservation, narrow your search with a
smaller date range. To expand your search, expand the date range to include dates,
weeks, months, or even years.

5. Click **Refresh** to display the search results on the screen.

If the search yields only one result, it will automatically open on your display. If the
search yields multiple results, a list will display on the screen.

If the search yields multiple results:
- Click **Print** to print a list of results.
- Double-click a reservation to view open it and view details about it.
