4. Input a **date range**.
5. Type the search criteria under the Search Field.
Some Search Options do not give you the option to type; there are Search Options
with preset Search Field options. For example: the Search Option “Room Type."

<div class="alert alert-info"><p>There are specific and general search option criteria. For example, a search for Guest
ID # could yield a more exact result than a search for Guest Last Name if the guest
has a common surname.</p></div>

If you know the approximate date of the reservation, narrow your search with a
smaller date range. To expand your search, expand the date range to include dates,
weeks, months, or even years.

6. Click to display the search results on the screen.
If the search yields only one result, it will automatically open on your display. If the
search yields multiple results, a list will display on the screen.
If the search yields multiple results:
Click Print to print a list of results.
Double-click to open a reservation to view its details.
