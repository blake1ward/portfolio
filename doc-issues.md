Escalate an issue to a supervisor if there is an issue in a hotel's Visual Matrix software that doesn't appear to have a solution.

There are two parts to escalating an issue: 

- Get a copy of the database
- Send an email to the supervisors

## Databases

- If it is a ledger report issue, get a copy of the **post-audit database**. 
- If it is not a ledger report issue, get a copy of the **most up-to-date database**.

**Post-Audit Database**

1. Go to file path:
    `C:\ImageTech\VisualMatrix\Shared\Backup\VM_"day"_Post.dbk`
2. Right click the database -> Send To -> Compressed (zipped) Folder.

3. Rename the database.

    - Format: Property ID_Property Name_Date.zip (e.g., 01234_SpringHotel_feb62017.zip)
    
4. Upload the database to the FTP site.

5. Note the name of the database in your email, so the supervisor can easily locate it.

**Up-to-Date Database**

1. In Visual Matrix, go to Front Office->Supervisor->System Maintenance then click **Backup**.

2. Find the backup in file path:
    `C:\ImageTech\VisualMatrix\Shared\Backup\VM"date".dbk`

3. Rename the database, and upload it to the FTP site (see steps 3, 4, and 5, above).

## Email

- If you show a team leader and the problem persists, email it to the supervisors.
- Send your email to supervisor@vmpms.com. 
- In the subject line put the property name/ID, summary of the issue, and ticket number.
    - `Blake's Hotel | Property ID: 12345 | Advance Deposit Report Incorrect | Ticket: 98765`
- In your email, describe the problem like you are speaking to a total beginner. Keep your email direct and professional; do not rant in your email.
