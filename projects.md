<p>Here are some writing and editing proejcts I selected from my portfolio.</p>
<ul>
<li href="#okb">Online knowledge base</li>
<li href="#pci">Payment card industry (PCI) compliance</li>
<li href="#clinic">Clinical forms</li>
<li href="#kit">Product kit labels</li>
<li href="#other">Other projects</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="okb">Online knowledge base</h3>
<p><strong>Tools used: Adobe InDesign (for print layout), Adobe Photoshop (to crop images and make .gifs), KnowledgeOWL (to host knowledgebase), HTML, and CSS</strong></p>

<p>When I started with Image, their documentation was incomplete and out of date. Starting from scratch, I wrote and edited articles for both a desktop and (new) cloud version of the software. The knowledge base is a portal for end users as well as technical support agents — by using a unique login, internal users have access to troubleshooting guides. I used Knowledge Owl CMS to create a knowledge base to support both versions of the application.</p>

<p>There are over 200 articles in this knowledge base. Here are some sample .pdf exports that users can generate:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#">End-user documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Troubleshooting guides</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Installation guides</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Configuration guides</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#">I also created gifs</a> of the most common functions to use as a "Quick Reference Guide."</p>

<p>The knowledge base is used by hotels in over 30 countries.</p>

<p>Using Google Analytics and Hotjar, I monitored how users approached the knowledge base. I logged in daily to check heatmaps and user trends to tailor the knowledge base to the clients’ needs. Image was able to cut costs on the server they had to run their old documentation on, and they got a new, up-to-date knowledge portal for all of their users.</p>

<p>The knowledge base is also layed out as two manuals ready for print (one desktop software manual, one cloud version manual)</p>

<h3 id="pci">Payment card industry (PCI) compliance</h3>

<p><strong>Tools used: Microsoft Word</strong></p>

<img href="#">

<p>This software application is used in conjunction with a credit card interface. As such, the software security must be in compliance with industry standards.</p>

<p>I edited existing documentation, interviewed SMEs, and worked with a security assessor to write security standards.</p>

<p>Click below to open a new tab with a PCI sample. I removed screenshots and any otherwise sensitive information from the documentation, including the company’s name, so all that remains in these documents is my writing.</p>

<h3 id="clinical">Clinical forms</h3>

<p><strong>Tools used: Adobe Illustrator (the existing method of creating forms when I arrived)</strong></p>

<img href="" alt="">

<p>Thermi's flagship product is a minimally-invasive skin tightening device. It uses radiofrequency to heat the subdermal tissue in the skin to form collagen, causing tightening. When a device was sold to a new doctor, Thermi's clinical staff had to visit the office to perform training. This is the documentation for their training. I collaborated with nurses on the clinical team and my colleague at Thermi to create new forms as needed and keep old forms up-to-date. Click below to open a new tab with a clinical form.</p>

<h3 id="kit">Product Kit Labels</h3>

<p><strong>Tools used: Adobe Illustrator</strong></p>

<img href="" alt="labels">

<p>In order to ship, Thermi's products must be labeled properly. The rules dictating what a label must show are governed by the FDA. I worked with Thermi's regulatory department to create and modify labels like the one shown above.</p>
